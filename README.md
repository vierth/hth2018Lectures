# Hacking the Humanities Lecture Slides
I will be uploading the lectures from my Hacking the Humanities class here. This way students and interested parties can access them easily.

[September 24 Lecture](https://vierth.github.io/hth2018Lectures/Sept24)

[September 17 Lecture](https://vierth.github.io/hth2018Lectures/Sept17)

The slides themselves are created using the reveal.js library, which you can find at https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js
